# Radiohead From the Project BUAAHND_G3T1_SI

This project is named as Radiohead which contains an application related to a band named Radiohead developed by me as the final assignment of the course **Scripting for Interactivity** during Term 1 of Grade 3 in BUAA HND.

Adobe Animate CC 2019 together with ActionScript 3.0 which has been used to develop the application is recommended to run the application to avoid any capability issues. The objectives of the application are:

* to introduce a band named Radiohead and its members
* to provide a music player and the band's top 10 music
* to display some brilliant photos of the band
